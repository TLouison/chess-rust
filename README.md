# chess-rust
As an attempt to get comfortable with working with Rust, I decided to implement Chess with a fully Rust backend. This is to get more comfortable with very important concepts in Rust such as borrowing rules, structuring data approriately, and working with the compiler to help reduce bugs.

Once the backend engine is complete, the next step is to use rust-wasm to generate a WebAssembly script that will allow the program to interface with a web application, and allow UI-based gameplay.

Eventually, this may also serve as a base for learning more about Rust GUI development.
